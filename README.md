#  GESTUREVOICE-CONTROLLER 

**GESTUREVOICE-CONTROLLER** is a futuristic, hands-free interface that lets you control your Windows computer using AI. It replaces your physical mouse and keyboard with **Hand Gestures** and **Voice Commands**.

It uses **Computer Vision** (to track your fingers) and **Natural language processing** (to listen to commands) in real-time.

#  Installation (Get Started)

To run this project on your own computer, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Python** (Version 3.10 or higher).
2. **Download this repository** folder ("GestureVoiceController").
3. **Open the folder** in your terminal/command prompt.
4. **Install the required AI tools** by running this command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
Start the AI by running:Bashpython main.py

# How to Control (User Manual)
The system tracks specific points on your hand (Landmarks) to trigger actions.
( Control GuideActionHand UsedGesture / TriggerMove Mouse👉 Right HandPoint your Index Finger to move the cursor.)
*Left Click👉 Right HandPinch (Index + Thumb) quickly.
*Drag & Drop👉 Right HandPinch & HOLD (wait 0.5s for red dot), move, then release.
*Volume DOWN👈 Left HandPinch Closed (bring fingers together).Volume UP👈 Left HandOpen Hand Wide (spread fingers apart).
*Right Click👈 Left HandPeace Sign ✌️ (Index & Middle fingers UP).
*Voice Command⌨️ KeyboardPress 'S' key and speak (e.g., "Open Notepad").
*Quit App⌨️ KeyboardPress 'Q' key.

# Features
